# Test strategy

IssueScout validates behavior at the narrowest useful boundary and retains a
small production-shaped journey across the entire anonymous stack. All
required suites are deterministic, parallel-safe, and independent of live
GitHub availability.

Tests assert observable behavior. Internal helper calls are asserted only when
the call count is itself a bounded-resource or retry invariant.

## Commands

Install the locked dependencies once:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

Run the normal suites:

```sh
pnpm run test:api
pnpm run test:web
pnpm run test:dev
pnpm run e2e
```

Run the strict quality evidence:

```sh
pnpm run coverage:api
pnpm run fuzz:api
pnpm run performance:api
pnpm run docs:go:check
pnpm run coverage:web
pnpm run bundle:check
pnpm run contracts:check
pnpm run http:check
```

`pnpm run quality:strict` combines the complete repository gate. To investigate
intermittency before opening a pull request, run the affected suite twice:

```sh
pnpm run test
pnpm run test
pnpm run e2e
pnpm run e2e
```

No test command requires `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

Go examples run as ordinary `go test` cases and remain deterministic, offline,
and credential-free. They exercise safe configuration defaults, cache
ownership isolation, GitHub cancellation, response/error encoding, and full
anonymous router composition. `pnpm run docs:go:check` independently parses
production Go source and rejects a missing or non-canonical package,
declaration, method, constant, sentinel, or interface-method comment.

Ordinary tests also require no database. Router tests inject a recording
database health port and prove that process health, profile analysis,
repository discovery, issue search, and issue detail cause zero database
calls. PostgreSQL repository tests assert parameterized account ownership and
safe error mapping. Authentication tests additionally cover PKCE, encrypted
flow-cookie tamper/expiry, single-use state, denial, Cookie attributes,
constant-time CSRF decisions, rotation, logout, and the zero-DB anonymous
short circuit. `pnpm run migrations:check` validates the forward-only catalog
without a live service.

An explicit clean-schema integration is available only with an approved,
disposable `TEST_DATABASE_URL`:

```sh
go -C apps/api test -run TestMigrationsAgainstConfiguredPostgreSQL \
  ./internal/database/postgres

go -C apps/api test -run TestAuthRepositoryAgainstConfiguredPostgreSQL \
  ./internal/database/postgres
```

Each uses a random isolated schema and removes that schema after verification.
The authentication case verifies state replay rejection, stable identity
linking, session rotation and revocation, plus hashed-only credential storage.
Pull request CI intentionally receives no database secret.

## Deterministic GitHub adapter

The built-stack suite starts the compiled API with:

```text
APP_ENV=test
USE_GITHUB_API_MOCK=true
```

Configuration rejects mock mode in development, staging, and production. The
adapter never opens a network connection and never falls back to the live
GitHub client.

| Input              | Result                                                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `octocat`          | complete profile, repository, search candidate, and issue detail |
| `no-results`       | valid profile and an explicit empty issue result                 |
| `missing-user`     | GitHub user not found                                            |
| `rate-limited`     | GitHub rate-limit error                                          |
| any other username | not found, with no live fallback                                 |

Add a scenario only when it represents reusable application behavior. Return
fresh domain values, honor `context.Context`, and cover the scenario in the
adapter unit test and the narrowest browser or handler test.

## Live GitHub client tests

The production adapter uses `httptest.Server` or an injected round tripper.
Coverage includes:

- malformed and oversized payloads;
- cancellation and upstream timeout;
- 404, 403, and rate-limit mapping;
- exactly one attempt for non-retryable responses;
- at most three attempts for 502, 503, 504, and transport failures;
- response-body closure, bounded pagination, and bounded GraphQL windows.
- one repository search plus at most one batched repository enrichment request.

Run these tests with the race detector through `pnpm run coverage:api`.
Cancellation tests must finish from context signals rather than arbitrary
sleep-based synchronization.

## Fuzz and performance gates

CI executes exactly 50,000 fuzz cases per target for GitHub usernames, issue
search values, repository-discovery values, and issue references. The fixed
execution budget avoids runner-speed-dependent timeouts while preserving a
reproducible minimum test depth. A discovered corpus file is a regression
asset: inspect it, retain it under the owning package when useful, and add a
named unit test when the behavior deserves explanation.

The four bounded domain benchmarks run three fixed 100-operation samples.
`config/quality-budgets.json` sets fail-closed time, byte, and allocation
ceilings. Budgets include broad runner headroom; a budget increase requires a
measured explanation in the pull request. Web gzip limits are enforced from
the same file.

| Budget                                               |      Maximum |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -----------: |
| `BenchmarkAnalyzeIssueBoundedRichInput` latency      |      5 ms/op |
| Analysis bytes                                       |   256 KiB/op |
| Analysis allocations                                 |       200/op |
| `BenchmarkAnalyzeProfileSnapshotBounded` latency     |      2 ms/op |
| Profile analysis bytes                               |   512 KiB/op |
| Profile analysis allocations                         |     5,000/op |
| `BenchmarkAnalyzeRepositoryDiscoveryBounded` latency |     50 ms/op |
| Repository discovery bytes                           |   128 KiB/op |
| Repository discovery allocations                     |     1,000/op |
| `BenchmarkRecommendBounded` latency                  |      1 ms/op |
| Recommendation bytes                                 |   128 KiB/op |
| Recommendation allocations                           |     1,000/op |
| Largest JavaScript asset                             |  75 KiB gzip |
| All JavaScript and CSS                               | 209 KiB gzip |

Production-oriented orchestration tests additionally prove a 50-candidate
window, exactly 20 unique detail leaders, no more than five active detail
operations, prompt cancellation, and fixed cache capacity under concurrent
churn. The built deterministic API enforces the original 3-second normal-route
and 10-second profile-analysis targets. These latency gates exclude internet
variance; live conditions are defined in
[Production readiness](production-readiness.md).

## Contract fixtures

`packages/contracts/fixtures/manifest.json` maps each JSON document to one
OpenAPI component schema. `pnpm run contracts:fixtures` validates types,
required fields, formats, enums, and bounds. It also mutates every valid
fixture to prove unknown envelope/payload fields and missing metadata fail.
Backend tests decode those documents through concrete response types.
Playwright uses the profile fixtures for its focused network-boundary test.

`pnpm run contracts:examples:check` also proves the interactive examples are
generated from those validated fixtures. Playwright loads `/docs/` at desktop
and mobile widths, verifies keyboard entry, fetches `/openapi.yaml`, and fails
if Swagger performs a non-local runtime request.

The [HTTPYAC collection](httpyac.md) covers all OpenAPI operations plus
important validation, origin, CSRF, and authentication failures. Its checker
rejects literal credentials, proves anonymous requests remain credential-free,
and runs every request through the real pinned parser against an ephemeral
loopback server. It performs no GitHub, OAuth, or database I/O.

When an HTTP response changes:

1. update `packages/contracts/openapi.yaml`;
2. update or add the representative JSON fixture;
3. update the handler and focused tests;
4. run `pnpm run contracts:check`;
5. never edit generated TypeScript manually.

## E2E failure diagnosis

Playwright runs against the production Vite build and compiled Go binary.
Retries are enabled only in CI. On failure, inspect:

- `playwright-report/` for the HTML timeline;
- `test-results/` for retained trace, screenshot, and video;
- API structured logs for the request ID shown in the UI or response;
- the failing response in the trace network panel.

Open a trace locally with:

```sh
pnpm exec playwright show-trace test-results/<test>/trace.zip
```

Do not point the E2E build at a developer API or enable `reuseExistingServer`
while diagnosing CI-only behavior. Stop those processes first so Playwright
owns both ports.

## Native lifecycle and release tests

`pnpm run test:dev` starts real native child process groups and verifies
cleanup when startup is interrupted and after readiness. Its integration case
sends SIGTERM to the actual supervisor, then proves both API and web ports are
closed.

`pnpm run dev:smoke` proves the local Go/Vite stack without a token.
`pnpm run release:reproducibility v0.0.0-test` performs two independent
builds, contract and checksum verification, extracted-content secret scanning,
byte comparison, packaged readiness, request-correlation, and graceful
shutdown checks.
