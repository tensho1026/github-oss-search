# MVP compliance matrix

This document traces the original IssueScout MVP completion conditions to
production code, executable tests, and operator documentation. It is a
release checklist, not a replacement for the detailed product and engineering
guides.

## User journey

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Input["Validated GitHub username"] --> Profile["Public profile and technology evidence"]
    Profile --> Search["Shareable bounded issue filters"]
    Search --> Rank["Rule-based analysis and deterministic ranking"]
    Rank --> Detail["Explainable issue detail"]
    Detail --> GitHub["Canonical GitHub issue"]
    Search --> Empty["Explicit empty / partial / error states"]
```

The complete path is exercised against a compiled Go binary and production
Vite build by `completes profile, search, and detail through the built API` in
[`smoke.spec.ts`](../apps/web/e2e/smoke.spec.ts). No live GitHub or database
dependency is involved in that release-blocking journey.

The latency checks use the compiled production applications with the
deterministic in-process GitHub adapter. They measure IssueScout overhead and
bounded orchestration without internet variance. Live latency additionally
depends on GitHub response time and rate-limit state; see
[Production readiness](production-readiness.md).

## Extensions beyond the original MVP

The original MVP explicitly allowed OAuth and persistence to be deferred.
IssueScout now provides them as optional, isolated capabilities:

- GitHub OAuth Authorization Code + PKCE with minimum `read:user`;
- Neon-compatible TLS PostgreSQL persistence;
- bookmarks and saved searches;
- preferences, privacy export, and confirmed account deletion.

These additions do not change MVP compliance: every public journey remains
anonymous and database-free. AI analysis, notifications, automatic claiming,
and pull-request creation remain outside the delivered boundary. See
[Known limitations and extension seams](limitations.md).

## Release verification

From a clean checkout:

```sh
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm run quality:strict
pnpm run e2e
pnpm run release:reproducibility v0.0.0-handover
```

For a fast credential-free product proof:

```sh
make dev-smoke
```

For every API operation and important negative boundary:

```sh
pnpm run http:check
```

No completion row may be changed to partial or deferred without a dedicated
issue, updated product decision, and corresponding contract/test changes.
